# Caffe port for VS2013 
Forked from ([NVIDIA/caffe](https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe)) for using in DIGITS

# Setup step:
1. Unzip `3rdparty.7z` into the caffe root
2. Run  `./src/caffe/proto/extract_proto.bat` to create `caffe.pb.h`, `caffe.pb.cc` and `caffe_pb2.py`
3. Build project in Debug/Release mode.

# MNIST test:
1. Unzip `./examples/mnist/mnist_leveldb.7z` into `/examples/mnist/`
2. Run `./train_lenet_debug.bat`  or `train_lenet_release.bat` according to your project settings

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
